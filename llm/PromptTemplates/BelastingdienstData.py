    From the Belastingdienst site: you can get fines for:
	•	not (or late) doing an aangifte (tax return) → “aangifteverzuim”  ￼
	•	not (or late) paying the tax you owe → “betaalverzuim”  ￼
	•	intentional or gross negligence (“opzet” or “grove schuld”) → leads to a “vergrijpboete” for serious cases.  ￼
	•	other taxes like motor vehicle tax (“motorrijtuigenbelasting”) also have specific rules for fine amounts.  ￼

Specific amounts & rules

Here are some of the concrete rules and amounts:

For VAT (BTW)
	•	If you pay late: normally you may get a payment-delay fine of 3% of the unpaid amount, with a minimum € 50 and maximum € 6 709 per year.  ￼
	•	If you under‐paid or got too much refunded and this is due to your fault: a vergrijpboete can be up to 100% of the unpaid / wrongly refunded amount.  ￼
	•	For late or missing VAT returns (“aangifteverzuim”): standard fine is € 82, but in exceptional cases up to € 165.  ￼

For Motor Vehicle Tax (Motorrijtuigenbelasting)
	•	If you have a “naheffingsaanslag” and you failed to declare or pay properly: the fine is ½ of the unpaid tax amount, with a minimum € 50 and maximum € 6 709.  ￼
	•	If you just pay late/insufficiently (verzuim): each verzuim may incur a fine of € 67 (for one instance) and in extreme cases up to € 6 709.  ￼

Other general tax fines
	•	For regular cases of non-compliance (verzuimboete), the rule of 3% applies (min €50 / max €6,709) as for VAT.  ￼
	•	For intentional or gross negligence (“vergrijpboete”): can be very high, up to 100% (or more) of the unpaid or wrongly obtained amount.  ￼

Important notes
	•	The maximum €6,709 per year keeps recurring in many tax-types for standard fines.
	•	The minimum of €50 for many payment-delay fines also appears.
	•	The rules vary per tax type (VAT, income tax, motor vehicle tax, etc).
	•	If you believe you received a fine wrongly, you can file bezwaar (objection) within 6 weeks of the decision.  ￼
	•	For serious cases the tax authority may escalate to criminal prosecution.  ￼
